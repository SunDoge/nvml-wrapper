/*!
A complete, safe, and ergonomic Rust wrapper for the
[NVIDIA Management Library](https://developer.nvidia.com/nvidia-management-library-nvml)
(NVML), a C-based programmatic interface for monitoring and managing various states within
NVIDIA (primarily Tesla) GPUs.

```
# use nvml_wrapper::NVML;
# use nvml_wrapper::error::*;
# fn main() {
# test().unwrap();    
# }
# fn test() -> Result<()> {
let nvml = NVML::init()?;
// Get the first `Device` (GPU) in the system
let device = nvml.device_by_index(0)?;

let brand = device.brand()?; // GeForce on my system
let fan_speed = device.fan_speed()?; // Currently 17% on my system
let power_limit = device.enforced_power_limit()?; // 275k milliwatts on my system
let encoder_util = device.encoder_utilization()?; // Currently 0 on my system; Not encoding anything
let memory_info = device.memory_info()?; // Currently 1.63/6.37 GB used on my system

// ... and there's a whole lot more you can do. Everything in NVML is wrapped and ready to go
# Ok(())
# }
```

NVML is intended to be a platform for building 3rd-party applications, and is also the 
underlying library for NVIDIA's nvidia-smi tool.

It supports the following platforms:

* Windows
  * Windows Server 2008 R2 64-bit
  * Windows Server 2012 R2 64-bit
  * Windows 7 64-bit 
  * Windows 8 64-bit
  * Windows 10 64-bit
* Linux
  * 64-bit
  * 32-bit
* Hypervisors
  * Windows Server 2008R2/2012 Hyper-V 64-bit
  * Citrix XenServer 6.2 SP1+
  * VMware ESX 5.1/5.5

And the following products:

* Full Support
  * Tesla products Fermi architecture and up
  * Quadro products Fermi architecture and up
  * GRID products Kepler architecture and up
  * Select GeForce Titan products
* Limited Support
  * All GeForce products Fermi architecture and up

Although NVIDIA does not explicitly support it, most of the functionality offered
by NVML works on my dev machine (980 Ti). Even if your device is not on the list,
try it out and see what works:

```bash
cargo test
```

## Compilation

The NVML library comes with the NVIDIA drivers and is essentially present on any
system with a functioning NVIDIA graphics card. The compilation steps vary
between Windows and Linux, however.

### Windows

I have been able to successfully compile and run this wrapper's tests using
both the GNU and MSVC toolchains. An import library (`nvml.lib`) is included for
compilation with the MSVC toolchain.

The NVML library dll can be found at `%ProgramW6432%\NVIDIA Corporation\NVSMI\`
(which is `C:\Program Files\NVIDIA Corporation\NVSMI\` on my machine). I had to add
this folder to my `PATH` or place a copy of the dll in the same folder as the executable
in order to have everything work properly at runtime with the GNU toolchain. You may
need to do the same; I'm not sure if the MSVC toolchain needs this step or not.

### Linux

The NVML library can be found at `/usr/lib/nvidia-<driver-version>/libnvidia-ml.so`; on my
system with driver version 375.51 installed, this puts the library at
`/usr/lib/nvidia-375/libnvidia-ml.so`. You will need to create a symbolic link:

```bash
sudo ln -s /usr/lib/nvidia-<driver-version>/libnvidia-ml.so /usr/lib
```

## NVML Support

This wrapper is being developed against and currently supports NVML version
9. Each new version of NVML is guaranteed to be backwards-compatible according
to NVIDIA, so this wrapper should continue to work without issue regardless of
NVML version bumps.

## Rust Version Support

Currently supports Rust 1.20.0 or greater. The target version is the **latest**
stable version; I do not intend to pin to an older one at any time.

## Cargo Features

The `serde` feature can be toggled on in order to `#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)]`
for every NVML data structure.

/**
The main struct that this library revolves around.

According to NVIDIA's documentation, "It is the user's responsibility to call `nvmlInit()`
before calling any other methods, and `nvmlShutdown()` once NVML is no longer being used."
This struct is used to enforce those rules.

Also according to NVIDIA's documentation, "NVML is thread-safe so it is safe to make 
simultaneous NVML calls from multiple threads." In the Rust world, this translates to `NVML`
being `Send` + `Sync`. You can `.clone()` an `Arc` wrapped `NVML` and enjoy using it on any thread.

NOTE: If you care about possible errors returned from `nvmlShutdown()`, use the `.shutdown()`
method on this struct. **The `Drop` implementation ignores errors.**

When reading documentation on this struct and its members, remember that a lot of it, 
especially in regards to errors returned, is copied from NVIDIA's docs. While they can be found
online [here](http://docs.nvidia.com/deploy/nvml-api/index.html), the hosted docs are outdated and
do not accurately reflect the version of NVML that this library is written for; beware. You should
ideally read the doc comments on an up-to-date NVML API header. Such a header can be downloaded
as part of the [CUDA toolkit](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads).

    This static function can be called multiple times and multiple NVML structs can be
    used at the same time. NVIDIA's docs state that "A reference count of the number of 
    initializations is maintained. Shutdown only occurs when the reference count reaches 
    zero."
    
    In practice, there should be no need to create multiple `NVML` structs; wrap this struct
    in an `Arc` and go that route. 
    
    Note that this will initialize NVML but not any GPUs. This means that NVML can
    communicate with a GPU even when other GPUs in a system are bad or unstable.
